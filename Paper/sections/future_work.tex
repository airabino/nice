\section{Future Work}

This study introduces methodology that will be extended and applied in future work. Although possible, this study did not explicitly extend the methodology to simultaneously account for nodal and travel demand. This extension would be beneficial in order to understand how these two forms of charging demand interact with one-another and impact \gls{esn} performance. The primary limitation of the methodology is that it assumes system-level optimal routing, an altruistic behavior not likely to be seen in the real-world. Future studies will include a portion of demand whose routing is controlled by separate, non-optimal strategies in order to understand the impact that this will have on both \gls{esn} performance and optimal structure.
