title = {Electrification of light-duty vehicle fleet alone will not meet mitigation targets},
journal = {Nature Climate Change},
abstract = {Climate change mitigation strategies are often technology-oriented, and electric vehicles (EVs) are a good example of something believed to be a silver bullet. Here we show that current US policies are insufficient to remain within a sectoral CO2 emission budget for light-duty vehicles, consistent with preventing more than 2°C global warming, creating a mitigation gap of up to 19GtCO2 (28% of the projected 2015–2050 light-duty vehicle fleet emissions). Closing the mitigation gap solely with EVs would require more than 350 million on-road EVs (90% of the fleet), half of national electricity demand and excessive amounts of critical materials to be deployed in 2050. Improving average fuel consumption of conventional vehicles, with stringent standards and weight control, would reduce the requirement for alternative technologies, but is unlikely to fully bridge the mitigation gap. There is therefore a need for a wide range of policies that include measures to reduce vehicle ownership and usage.}

We apply this measure to two examples: a network of homosexual men diagnosed with AIDS, and observations on a colony of baboons. Comparisons are made with “betweenness” and “closeness” centrality measures. The processes by which structural changes in networks occur over time are also discussed.}

abstract = {Battery electric vehicle adoption research has been on going for two decades. The majority of data gathered thus far is taken from studies that sample members of the general population and not actual adopters of the vehicles. This paper presents findings from a study involving 340 adopters of battery electric vehicles. The data is used to corroborate some existing assumptions made about early adopters. The contribution of this paper, however, is the distinction between two groups of adopters. These are high-end adopters and low-end adopters. It is found that each group has a different socio-economic profile and there are also some psychographic differences. Further they have different opinions of their vehicles with high-end adopters viewing their vehicles more preferentially. The future purchase intentions of each group are explored and it is found that high-end adopters are more likely to continue with ownership of battery electric vehicles in subsequent purchases. Finally reasons for this are explored by comparing each adopter group’s opinions of their vehicles to their future purchase intentions. From this is it suggested that time to refuel and range for low-end battery electric vehicles should be improved in order to increase chances of drivers continuing with BEV ownership.}

abstract = {This paper presents a literature review of studies that investigate infrastructure needs to support the market introduction of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). It focuses on literature relating to consumer preferences for charging infrastructure, and how consumers interact with and use this infrastructure. This includes studies that use questionnaire surveys, interviews, modelling, GPS data from vehicles, and data from electric vehicle charging equipment. These studies indicate that the most important location for PEV charging is at home, followed by work, and then public locations. Studies have found that more effort is needed to ensure consumers have easy access to PEV charging and that charging at home, work, or public locations should not be free of cost. Research indicates that PEV charging will not impact electricity grids on the short term, however charging may need to be managed when the vehicles are deployed in greater numbers. In some areas of study the literature is not sufficiently mature to draw any conclusions from. More research is especially needed to determine how much infrastructure is needed to support the roll out of PEVs. This paper ends with policy implications and suggests avenues of future research.}

abstract = {A national network of DC Fast Charging infrastructure (DCFC) corridors can facilitate connectivity and long-distance travel using battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Optimal locations of such facilities are where BEV drivers have easy access to charging where drivers will not have to make any deviation from their pre-planned trips. Such optimally located corridor DCFCs are usually in remote, underserved communities and immediately next to a highway where they lack the advantages of shared utility infrastructure in an urban setting. Therefore, we find that other studies and industry knowledge of infrastructure investments do not apply to corridor DCFC locations. This study evaluates the full project costs of installing and commissioning 54 DC Fast Chargers in 36 sites located in major transportation corridors in California and finds significant variation in costs between them. While existing studies show costs ranging from $20,000 - $150,000, we find costs range anywhere between $122,000 and $440,000. This data is critical for new investment in the U.S. to construct a national charging network of DC Fast charging corridors. We find that a significant proportion of the full project costs are taken up by on site “make-ready infrastructure” costs that vary greatly due to site-specific factors and design choices. DCFC installations should be considered civil construction projects with significant electrical infrastructure planning and installation that requires the cooperation of many local stakeholders. We find that costs can be greatly reduced by working with local electrical utilities early in the design and site selection stages when possible. Our study finds that some cost shift towards utility side costs can greatly reduce overall construction costs for sites along highways. We also find that grid-connected DCFC design are substantially cheaper than off-grid solar powered DCFC with onsite storage.}

abstract = {A review of accessibility measures is presented for assessing the usability of these measures in evaluations of land-use and transport strategies and developments. Accessibility measures are reviewed using a broad range of relevant criteria, including theoretical basis, interpretability and communicability, and data requirements of the measures. Accessibility impacts of land-use and transport strategies are often evaluated using accessibility measures, which researchers and policy makers can easily operationalise and interpret, such as travelling speed, but which generally do not satisfy theoretical criteria. More complex and disaggregated accessibility measures, however, increase complexity and the effort for calculations and the difficulty of interpretation. The current practice can be much improved by operationalising more advanced location-based and utility-based accessibility measures that are still relatively easy to interpret for researchers and policy makers, and can be computed with state-of-the-practice data and/or land-use and transport models. Research directions towards theoretically more advanced accessibility measures point towards the inclusion of individual's spatial–temporal constraints and feedback mechanisms between accessibility, land-use and travel behaviour. Furthermore, there is a need for theoretical and empirical research on relationships between accessibility, option values and non-user benefits, and the measurement of different components of accessibility.}

In this essay, I reflect on why progress toward the wholesale adoption of an accessibility-oriented approach in planning practice has been slow, review some of the promising efforts in recent years that suggest that transportation planning may be on the cusp of an accessibility era, and offer thoughts about the power of the accessibility concept as a framework for thinking about the urban environment.}

abstract = {This paper analyses user preferences related to electric vehicle (EV) charging decisions. The analysis includes both a qualitative as well as a quantitative assessment. The qualitative assessment consists of a literature review of existing studies about EV charging behaviour and an analysis of semi-structured interviews with Danish EV users. This assessment identifies the most relevant factors for charging. In addition, it highlights that the time horizon of the charging decision is an essential factor. We use this to design two stated-choice (SC) experiments explicitly taking these findings into account. The first SC experiment looks into long-term decisions related to regular charging practices. The second SC experiment captures decisions related to occasional charging needs on longer trips. The SC data consist of three responses from 558 EV owners for each of the two experiments. We model the data using mixed logit models to allow for unobserved heterogeneity and the repeated nature of the SC data. The main findings indicate a high preference for all-inclusive/flat fee pricing structures. Moreover, they show that respondents value interoperability between charging networks, both nationally and internationally. Related to occasional charging, we find willingness-to-pay measures describing the detour respondents are willing to drive to obtain lower costs, a higher likelihood of available chargers, and facilities at the charging location. Overall the analyses highlight many factors that influence the charging decisions of consumers that are relevant for policymakers and charging operators. In addition, they highlight the barriers in a charging context, such as network roaming, lack of charging etiquette, and congestion at chargers.}

abstract = {This paper presents a quantitative investigation of the inconvenience of electric vehicle (EV) charging relative to internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) fuelling in terms of the time penalty likely to be experienced by drivers. A heuristic approach to deriving idealised charging schedules from over 39,000 week-long travel diaries from the UK National Travel Survey is presented in order to quantify the expected convenience parity — the point at which EV charging and ICEV fuelling are of comparable convenience — for combinations of battery capacity, charger power and access to charging at different locations (home, workplace and public destinations). It was found that although the majority — up to 95% — of individuals who can charge at home are expected to be able to reach convenience parity with battery sizes currently available in EV models at the ‘affordable’ end of the market, this is significantly less likely for those who rely on workplace or public charging — and particularly for those who must rely solely on en route charging. These individuals are expected to suffer considerable inconvenience associated with EV charging relative to ICEV fuelling, and although greater battery capacities and charger power ratings are expected to lessen this inconvenience, there remains a significant gap in the convenience of EV ownership between those who can charge while parked at home and those who cannot. Further analysis is carried out to long journeys that cannot be made on a single charge; ‘range anxiety’ being a major obstacle to widespread EV adoption. It was found that if drivers are compliant with the UK Highway Code in taking regular breaks on long journeys, fewer than 0.01% of trips are expected to be delayed by charging when using battery capacities of 40–60 kWh.}

abstract = {The use of cars in cities has many negative impacts, including pollution, noise and the use of space. Yet, detecting factors that reduce the use of cars is a serious challenge, particularly across different regions. Here, we model the use of various modes of transport in a city by aggregating Active mobility (A), Public Transport (B) and Cars (C), expressing the modal share of a city by its ABC triplet. Data for nearly 800 cities across 61 countries is used to model car use and its relationship with city size and income. Our findings suggest that with longer distances and the congestion experienced in large cities, Active mobility and journeys by Car are less frequent, but Public Transport is more prominent. Further, income is strongly related to the use of cars. Results show that a city with twice the income has 37% more journeys by Car. Yet, there are significant differences across regions. For cities in Asia, Public Transport contributes to a substantial share of their journeys. For cities in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, most of their mobility depends on Cars, regardless of city size. In Europe, there are vast heterogeneities in their modal share, from cities with mostly Active mobility (like Utrecht) to cities where Public Transport is crucial (like Paris or London) and cities where more than two out of three of their journeys are by Car (like Rome and Manchester).}

ABSTRACT = {Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is present all over the United States, but charging prices vary greatly, both in amount and in the methods by which they are assessed. For this paper, we interpret and analyze charging price information from PlugShare, a crowd-sourced EV charging data platform. Because prices in these data exist in a semi-structured textual format, an ad hoc text mining approach is used to extract quantitative price information. Descriptive analytics of the processed dataset demonstrate how the prices of EV charging vary with charging level (Direct Current Fast Charging versus Level 2), geographic location, network provider, and location type. Our research indicates that a great deal of diversity and flexibility exists in structuring the prices of EV charging to enable incentives for shaping charging behaviors, but that it has yet to be widely standardized or utilized. Comparisons with estimates of the levelized cost of EV charging illustrate some of the challenges associated with operating and using these stations.},

We also explore the direct and indirect effects of seeing public charging on PEV purchase consideration. Results show the density of public charging is neither directly nor indirectly related to whether people see public charging or their level of PEV purchase consideration. Our results suggests that for public charging to drive PEV sales growth, it may need to be accompanied by strategies to increase consumers’ engagement with PEVs.}

Self-Congruity theory proposes that products are preferred whose symbolic meanings are congruent with personal identity. Further, Construal Level theory suggests that only those who are psychologically close to a new product category through direct experience with it can make concrete construals related to their lifestyles; most drivers lack this for EVs. For instance, potential performance benefits of EVs might offset range limitations for consumers who have such direct experience. The effect of direct experience was tested in a randomised controlled trial with 393 mass-market consumer drivers. An experimental group were given direct experience of a modern battery electric vehicle (BEV), and a control group an equivalent conventional car. Despite rating the performance of the BEV more highly than that of the conventional car, willingness to consider a BEV declined after experience, particularly if the range of the BEV considered was short. The participants willing to consider a short-range BEV were those high in self-congruity, for whom the BEV could act as a strong symbol of personal identity.}

The actual adoption rate however of BEVs in Germany remains low, and strategies for enhancing BEV acceptance are required. Providing direct experience can, for instance, help to overcome prejudices relating to relatively new products, with this being a potential marketing strategy. The present research contributes to the question of what role direct experience plays in acceptance of BEVs. Two studies were conducted to address the relationship between these variables: (1) an online survey (N=286) and (2) a 24-h field test (N=30). Both studies showed several experience-based differences in evaluations of BEV attributes, attitude and purchase intention, with most BEV attributes being evaluated more positively when people had BEV experience. Path analyses revealed a direct experience effect on purchase intention in the online study. Findings from the 24-h field test, showed effects of BEV experience on BEV attributes and attitudes, but no BEV experience effect for purchase intention was found. Based on the results of both studies, we can conclude that practical (and also short-term) experience with BEVs has the potential to change the evaluation of BEVs and psychological factors relevant for determining behavioral intention. As many effects were positive, providing short-term BEV experience to enhance acceptance has the potential to change BEV evaluation as well as the satisfaction with such a vehicle and might be a promising strategy for promoting BEVs.}

The present research aimed to understand factors relating to individually perceived range satisfaction of battery electric vehicle (BEV) users. Data from a large-scale BEV field trial (N=2) were analyzed. Apart from an initial drop in range satisfaction, increasing practical experience was related to increased range satisfaction. Classical indicators of users' mobility profiles (daily travel distances) were only weakly related to lower range satisfaction (not significant), after controlling for practical experience and preferred coverage of mobility needs. The regularity/predictability of users' mobility patterns, the percentage of journeys not coverable because of range issues, and users’ individual comfortable range accounted for variance in range satisfaction. Finally, range satisfaction was related to key indicators of general BEV acceptance (e.g., purchase intentions). These results underline the complex dynamics involved in individual range satisfaction, as well as its central role for BEV acceptance.}

To design effective policies to stimulate the uptake of BEVs, it is essential to understand the barriers and drivers that influence consumers' choices for a BEV. To this aim, we present a computational model named CODEC, a hybrid choice model that estimates the future market share of different vehicle types. The model gives insight into the different effects of technical, financial and other behavioural factors that influence the adoption decision. We included social factors and routine behaviour, which are rarely analysed in other research. We assessed the share in sales of BEVs and gasoline vehicles in the Netherlands between 2020 and 2030 for privately owned new cars. To initialize the model we used data from a survey on the perceptions of prospective car buyers (n=1522). Our analysis shows that the BEV market share in new car sales will be between 26 and 40% in 2030, well below the government target of 100%. The analysis also shows that current barriers for BEV adoption: higher purchase price and lower driving range, will become less important over time. In 2030 routine purchasing behaviour and social factors are the main barriers for widespread BEV adoption. New policy measures are needed to lower these barriers. Factors that affect BEV adoption positively have a relatively small effect, so also measures to reduce the attractiveness of gasoline vehicles should be considered.}

Such a transition should involve each socio-technical system, including the transport system. Adopting a multi-level perspective, the present study explores the behaviour of actors within the road passenger transport sector by investigating roadblocks to the shift towards electric mobility. The study focuses specifically on regime actors, i.e. the whole of consumers (car drivers), industry actors (car manufacturers, suppliers), policymakers, and civil society (citizens, workers, trade unions, environmental organisations, NGOs) acting at regime level. Although these actors provide stability to the socio-technical system, they do not always oppose change. Indeed, they can actively support the transition pushing a reform agenda that fits their interests. The reframing of their behaviour becomes therefore essential for the regime change to occur. The analysis involved the systematic literature review of studies concerning the road transport regime actors. These included 44 publications related to the European continent in the period 2015–2020. The findings reveal a recent re-orientation of regime actors, with the presence of factors supporting change along with those reinforcing resistance. The firsts include the role of electric vehicles as symbols of social status and innovativeness, their environmentally sound for decarbonising transport, and the possibility for firms to pursue new business opportunities and models. In contrast, the emerged factors of resistance include uncertainty in demand and production scalability, the risk of job losses, the rigid value chain, and the lack of charging stations that makes electric vehicles not suitable in everyday life.}

While electric vehicle (EV) uptake is increasing in many countries, some nations – like Australia – are EV laggards. Here we analyse the stated preferences towards EVs of a representative sample of 500 Australian consumers by estimating a mixed logit model, which will help inform policy-makers in similar markets on how to potentially accelerate uptake. Additionally, the findings of this study are useful to EV manufacturers in exploring the specific vehicle features that are most attractive to consumers, and that are likely to be required to stimulate uptake in car-dependent markets, like Australia, with longer distances between urban areas. The attributes examined in this study include purchase price, driving range, fast charging time, public fast charger availability, financial incentives, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities. As one of the first consumer preference studies to include V2G capabilities, this study also aims to understand how broader potential energy benefits stemming from EV ownership are perceived by consumers, and whether these features could further stimulate uptake. As expected, purchase price, driving range, fast charging time, public fast charger availability and financial incentives in the form of energy bill discounts were found to be significant factors affecting the choice to purchase an EV. Interestingly, the availability of V2G was found to have a significant impact on consumer choice, with consumers’ marginal willingness-to-pay for these features ranging from AUD 2,319 to AUD 5,346, depending on the technical details of its implementation. As identified in other studies, younger consumers were found to be more likely to purchase an EV, and higher levels of EV awareness also have a significant positive impact.}

In this study, we analyze VMT of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) to understand PEV use and the factors that influence their use in a household. We use data from a unique repeat survey of PEV owners in California who were originally surveyed when they first bought their vehicle. Having two survey responses per household allows us to obtain more reliable VMT data and analyze the change in VMT over the vehicle ownership period. The results show that PEV VMT is correlated with traditional factors like population density, built environment, attitudes towards technology, and lifestyle preferences. Specific to PEVs, electric driving range and access to infrastructure, have a major influence on PEV VMT. Moreover, while lower electricity price at home may lead to a higher share of PEV VMT in total household VMT, we do not identify the presence of “rebound effect”. Overall, we observe that factors influencing PEV VMT are like those observed for conventional gasoline vehicles. We find that PEVs drive a similar amount as conventional vehicles, not less (due to range anxiety) as some have suggested. The results have implications for emissions impact assessments and travel demand models that depend on assumptions of average annual VMT for policymaking.}

The results show that battery state of charge (SOC) and the ability to reach the next station without deviating from the original plan are the primary factors influencing charging decisions. Charging cost, time, the detour time to reach a station, and the amenities are statistically significant predictors, but less important than SOC and the ability to complete the trip as planned. The comparison of the SDCMs and DDCMs shows that SDCMs have better goodness-of-fit than more complicated DDCMs. By comparing the relative size of the coefficient, we estimated the monetary value of increasing charging power, moving the charging stations closer to highway exits, and having amenities such as restrooms, restaurants, and Wi-Fi at the charging stations.}

abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for finding the K loopless paths that have the shortest lengths from one node to another node in a network. The significance of the new algorithm is that its computational upper bound increases only linearly with the value of K. Consequently, in general, the new algorithm is extremely efficient as compared with the algorithms proposed by Bock, Kantner, and Haynes [2], Pollack [7], [8], Clarke, Krikorian, and Rausan [3], Sakarovitch [9] and others. This paper first reviews the algorithms presently available for finding the K shortest loopless paths in terms of the computational effort and memory addresses they require. This is followed by the presentation of the new algorithm and its justification. Finally, the efficiency of the new algorithm is examined and compared with that of other algorithms.},

abstract={Serious environmental and economic problems of using fossil fuels in transportation sections force managers to think of alternative fuels such as hydrogen, ethanol, biodiesel, natural gas, or electricity. Meanwhile, lack of fuel network infrastructures is a major problem, which needs to be investigated considering the number and optimal location of alternative fuel stations. In the literature, two different flow-based demand modeling concepts (the maximum cover and set cover) have been proposed for solving this problem. Because of the huge number of combinations of fuel stations for covering the flow of each path, the models are impractical for the real size problems. In this paper, the flow refueling location model was reformulated and a flexible mixed-integer linear programming model was presented, which was able to obtain an optimal solution much faster than the previous set cover version. The model also could be solved in the maximum cover form in a reasonable time on the large-sized networks.},

abstract="We present alternative discrete choice models of route choice behavior in road networks. A route choice model has two components: 1. The generation of a choice set of alternative routes; and 2. The choice of route among the alternatives in the choice set. The route choice models used in traffic equilibrium tend to be very simple with implicit generation of very large path choice sets. The advent of Intelligent Transportation Systems has renewed the interest in modeling the effects of traffic information systems on route choice behavior. Developments in discrete choice methods have also led to the more sophisticated route choice models. We present results of a small sample route choice survey of MIT employees showing that only a small percentage of drivers select the minimum travel time, minimum distance or minimum generalized cost paths as calculated from the model of the road network. These results demonstrate that the usual deterministic route choice model can be rejected. We then focus on the formulation of probabilistic route choice models. We consider the problem of overlapping paths and the modified Logit solutions that have been developed: C-Logit and Path-Size Logit. We also consider applications to route choice of more general discrete choice models including Cross-Nested Logit, Probit and, ultimately, the Logit Kernel model, which is a flexible hybrid of Logit and Probit. The properties of the different models are examined using simple network examples. Finally, we present estimation results for the different choice models. The results show that the Logit Kernel model with a Path-Size term gives the best fit. The application of Probit and Logit Kernel models requires simulation. Among the closed-form models, the Cross-Nested Logit with a Path-Size term provides a slightly better fit then the Path-Size Logit. The Path-Size formulation appears to have significant explanatory power of the way travelers perceive the alternative paths in a road network.",

The analysis considers the case where a pool of travelers depart from a given origin to a single destination connected by two parallel alternative routes. Traffic conditions varying from day to day are represented by travel time. Travel time prediction errors (the difference between predicted and actual travel time) as well as actual travel times are treated as “experiences” accumulating through the experiments. It is found that the traffic flow seems to be hard to converge to an equilibrium, so that existing traffic assignment models may not be adequate to analyze actual traffic phenomena. Some important insights regarding the mechanism of driver's route choice behavior are also obtained by the experiments. For example, the results show that there exist two patterns of using previous travel experiences for prediction of travel time.}

Such an approach is consistent with expected and with non-expected utility theory. Econometric estimates suggest that absolute risk aversion is constant and show that risk aversion is larger for transit users, blue collars and for business appointments.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a route choice model that incorporates the various behavioral mechanisms in route choice proposed in the literature including the shortest path, bounded rationality, asymmetric preference, and the time surplus maximization. In the proposed model, travelers are assumed to compare travel cost to their status quo (travel cost of the currently used path) in deciding whether to switch to another alternative, and the underlying value of time is adaptive in the sense that it varies across different route choice contexts. We find that the status quo-dependent route choice model can handle the route choice inertia resulting from different sources (e.g., travelers’ misperceptions, satisficing behavior, asymmetric preference). Moreover, the inertia is path-specific and can incorporate the scaling effect of travel cost on travelers’ route choices. Examples are provided to illustrate the proposed status quo-dependent route choice model as well as its connection with various existing route choice models.}

abstract = {In this review paper, we delve into the supply-side challenges and considerations for transitioning to 100% zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), weaving together an analysis of batteries, vehicle production, charging infrastructure, and relevant supply-side policies. We begin by examining the innovations and environmental impacts of lithium mining and recycling, highlighting the need for robust frameworks to ensure sustainable battery production. Our exploration of vehicle production reveals important issues regarding labor dynamics and global competitiveness. Our investigation into charging infrastructure reveals complexities in deployment models and access, reflecting broader societal and economic considerations. Lastly, a critical evaluation of policies across various jurisdictions provides insights into the effectiveness and potential improvements needed to support the ZEV transition. We emphasize the need for coordinated efforts and further research, particularly in areas such as end-of-life considerations for batteries and the alignment of international production standards. Our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the supply-side landscape for ZEVs and underscore the essential research directions to ensure a responsible and successful electrification of the transportation system.}

abstract = {The rapid growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) has led to issues such as insufficient and unevenly distributed charging stations, posing an increasingly severe challenge. This not only means higher economic and time costs for EV users traveling to charging stations, but also indicates that EVs need to incur additional energy consumption. To address these challenges, this paper first establishes an extended space-time-state network to describe the temporal variability and uncertainty of the traffic environment. Secondly, considering the impact of the energy consumption incurred by EVs traveling to charging stations (CSs) on the layout of CSs, a co-evolutionary optimization model of the location-routing problem is proposed. To solve the model, a two-stage Adaptive Co-evolutionary Clustering Algorithm (ACECA) integrating an adaptive clustering framework and a co-evolutionary mechanism is designed. Finally, the experiment results indicate that there exists a game between a short-term economic investment and long-term benefits of energy conservation and emission reduction. Moreover, ACECA demonstrates stronger solution performance and robustness compared to other algorithms, with the resulting CS location schemes showing superior advantages in energy conservation and in cost saving for users. The research findings can provide theoretical support for the planning of charging station locations for electric vehicles.}

abstract = {This paper investigates a widely discussed class of charging station location problems for the en-route charging need of electric vehicles traveling in intercity highway networks. Due to the necessity for multiple charges along an intercity long-haul trip, this type of charging station location problems implies such an individual behavior that electric vehicle drivers make self-optimal route-and-charge decisions while ensuring the driving range of their vehicles to sustain trips without running out of charge. The main contribution of this paper is on analytically and computationally comparing the modeling and solution methods for the charging station location problems within uncongested and congested networks. Two distinct modeling frameworks are presented and analyzed: A metanetwork-based two-stage model for uncongested networks and a network-based bi-level model for congested networks. Both models are tackled by the classic branch-and-bound algorithm, which, however, resorts to different problem decomposition schemes, subregion bounding strategies, and network flow evaluation methods. Specifically, for uncongested networks, a two-phase procedure first employs a bi-criterion label-correcting algorithm for constructing a metanetwork and then implements the branch-and-bound algorithm on the metanetwork embedding a single-criterion label-setting algorithm for deriving network flows; on the other hand, for congested networks, the branch-and-bound algorithm is directly applied on the original network encapsulating a convex combinations method for deriving network flows. Finally, the two network scenarios and their modeling and solution methods are quantitatively evaluated with two real-world highway networks, in terms of implementation complexity, solution efficiency, and routing behavior.}

abstract = {The deployment of mobile renewable energy charging stations plays a crucial role in facilitating the overall adoption of electric vehicles and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. This study addresses the dynamic capacitated facility location problem in mobile charging stations from a sustainability perspective. This paper proposes Two-stage stochastic programming with recourse that performs well for this application, and the location of the mobile renewable energy charging station (MRECS) management addresses the complex dynamics of reusable items. To solve this problem, we suggested dealing with differential evolutionary (DE) and DE Q-learning (DEQL) algorithms, as two novel optimization and reinforcement learning approaches, are presented as solution approaches to validate their performance. Evaluation of the outcomes reveals a considerable disparity between the algorithms, and DEQL performs better in solving the presented problem. In addition, DEQL could minimize the total operation cost and carbon emission by 7% and 20%, respectively. In contrast, the DE could decrease carbon emissions and total operation costs by 5% and 2.5%, respectively.}

The proposed algorithms handle multiple objectives simultaneously based on dominance principles and crowding distance evaluation. In addition, multi-attribute decision-making method-based selection scheme for identifying the best solutions from the Pareto fronts is included. The proposed algorithm performances are investigated on a case study of solar-assisted Brayton heat engine system and a case study of Stirling heat engine system to see whether there can be any improvement in the performances of the considered systems. Furthermore, the efficiencies of the Rao algorithms are evaluated in terms of spacing, hypervolume, and coverage metrics. The results obtained by the proposed algorithms are compared with those obtained by the latest advanced optimization algorithms. It is observed that the results obtained by the proposed algorithms are superior. The performances of the considered case studies are improved by the application of the proposed optimization algorithms.

abstract = {Dominance is a fundamental concept in Multiobjective Optimization (MOO) where a solution is said to dominate the other if it is better in at least one objective, and same as or better in the other objectives. Given a pair of solutions, if neither dominates the other, then the solutions are said to be non-dominated. In real spaces, a large number of non-dominated solutions can exist in principle, making convergence of MOO techniques rather slow. Relaxed forms of dominance have been proposed in the literature for faster convergence. One such form is the ∊-dominance, which in principle, partitions the space into ∊-sized grids. The value of ∊ is often user defined and the performance of ∊-dominance based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (∊-MOEAs) critically depends on the value of ∊. In this article we propose a novel way of determining the value of ∊, which is different for each objective function, based on the correlation between them. We call this approach Priority Based ∊ (PBE) as the method ranks the objectives according to their priority before calculating the ∊ values. PBE is incorporated in an archived simulated annealing based MOO technique called AMOSA. AMOSA has been earlier shown to outperform several well-known MOO techniques especially for many objective optimization. PBE based AMOSA, referred to as PBE-AMOSA, is found to comprehensively outperform AMOSA, MOEA/D-DE, the conventional ∊ based version ∊-AMOSA and ∊-MOEA both in case of benchmark test problems and 0/1 knapsack problem.}

The target of this optimization model is to minimize the time cost to electric vehicle drivers. We use the SCE-UA algorithm to solve the optimization model. We apply our method to Dalian, China to optimize charging station locations. We also analyze the optimized result with or without behavior prediction, the optimized result of different numbers of electric vehicles, and the optimized result of different cost constraints. The analysis shows the feasibility and advantages of the charging station location optimization method proposed in this paper. }

abstract = {As clean energy vehicles, electric vehicles (EVs) have been paid unprecedented attention in dealing with serious energy crises and heavy tailpipe emission in recent years. Due to its limited battery range and long charging time, it's significant to reasonably determine the locations and capacities of EV charging infrastructure. There are two research gaps in existing researches: unrealistically assuming the infinite queuing length based on the M/M/1 or M/M/S queuing model and lacking the research on variable quantities of chargers allocated at different charging stations. To fill up these gaps, we propose an optimal location model to determine the optimal locations and capacities of EV charging infrastructure to minimize the comprehensive total cost, which considers the charging queuing behavior with finite queue length and various siting constrains. And the results show that (1) the proposed model has a good performance in determining the optimal locations and capacities of EV charging infrastructure (i.e. the optimal locations of charging stations, the optimal quantities of chargers installed at each charging station, the optimal allowable maximum queue length and maximum capacity of each charging station); (2) the quantity of chargers and allowable maximum queue length at each charging station are consistent with the distribution densities of existing charging stations at these locations; (3) the two parameters of unit value of time and unit distance cost have a more significant impact on the total cost. Therefore, the total cost can be effectively reduced by appropriately increasing the quantity of chargers at each charging station and the distribution density of charging stations.}

However, charging imbalances and shortages have limited the prevalence of EVs. We optimize the siting and sizing of public charging stations under uncertain urban en-route recharging demand. Considering charging congestion, we introduce the Erlang’s loss formula to represent the service level requirement of each charging station. First, we determine the optimal locations and sizes of those stations by a robust optimization model, where we figure out its deterministic dual following linear approximation of the loss rate in queueing models. We further use a discrete-event simulation to relax the assumption of time-independent charging demand in the optimization approach and model real-time traffic based on real-world traffic and power grid information in Nanjing, China. Thus, we verify the robust optimum outperforming deterministic and stochastic optimums.}

The proposed approach simultaneously determines the location and capacity of charging stations (i.e., number of charging piles), and assigns piles to electric vehicles based on their level of charge. The problem is formulated as a bi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming model to minimize the total cost of establishing charging stations together with the average customers’ waiting time. The proposed solution combines queueing theory with mathematical modelling to estimate the average waiting time. A deep learning algorithm is then developed to enhance the precision of waiting time estimation. Another contribution is involving a deep neural network model in improving NSGA-II algorithm. Numerical experiments are conducted in Halifax, Canada to assess the performance of the proposed framework. The results demonstrate the strong predictive performance of the deep learning algorithm and highlight the limitations of traditional queueing models in estimating waiting times in charging stations (i.e., 99.8% improvement in computation time, as well as accuracy improvement of time estimations from 13% to 1.6% deviation). Several valuable insights are obtained to improve the operational performance of charging stations such as achieving a significant (i.e., 61.5%) drop in the average waiting time across the network by a modest (i.e., 29.2%) increase in the initial investments. Also, it reveals that the variability of service rate significantly impacts the average waiting time (i.e., a 50% increase in the variability of service rate causes a substantial 950.56% surge in the average waiting time). The findings underscore the need to control service rate fluctuations to reduce wait times and boost driver satisfaction. The improved NSGA-II algorithm shows 12.77% improvement in the Pareto front solutions. Finally, the proposed prioritization strategy based on the charging level of vehicles could reduce the average waiting time and cost compared to the first-come-first-served strategy.}

Considering that different users may have different perception of station access cost and charging cost, two cases (i.e., homogeneous users and heterogeneous users) are typically investigated. The impacts of different discount rates, operating period of the charging stations, number of electric vehicles and number of charging stations on the location of the charging station are also studied. The simulation results not only show that it is very important to locate the charging stations according to the traveling behavior of users, but also verify the validity of the proposed model.}

ABSTRACT = {The development of electric vehicles has significant value for the sustainable utilization of energy resources. However, the unreasonable construction of charging stations causes problems such as low user satisfaction, waste of land resources, unstable power systems, and so on. Reasonable planning of the location and capacity of charging stations is of great significance to users, investors and power grids. This paper synthetically considers three indicators of user satisfaction: charging convenience, charging cost and charging time. Considering the load and charging requirements, the model of electric vehicle charging station location and volume is established, and the model based on artificial immune algorithm is used to optimize the solution. An empirical analysis was conducted based on a typical regional survey. The research results show that increasing the density of charging stations, lowering the charging price and shortening the charging time can effectively improve user satisfaction. The constructed site and capacity selection optimization solving model can scientifically guide charging station resource allocation under the constraints of the optimal user comprehensive satisfaction target, improve the capacity of scientific planning and resource allocation of regional electric vehicle charging stations, and support the large-scale promotion and application of electric vehicles.},

We find that 67\% of the feeders in California will need capacity upgrades by 2045, with a total of 25 GW upgrades needed, corresponding to a cost between \$6 and \$20 billion. However, the effect of the additional cost is offset by downward pressure on electricity rates due to the overall growth in electricity consumption, leading to an overall rate reduction between \$0.01 and \$0.06/kWh. Our work indicates that feeders in residential areas will require twice as much upgrade compared to commercial areas, revealing the potential to ease the grid’s stress by shifting home-charging demand. California, a pioneer in EV adoption, has enacted ambitious electric vehicle (EV) policies that will generate a large burden on the state’s electric distribution system. We investigate the statewide impact of uncontrolled EV charging on the electric distribution networks at a large scale and high granularity, by employing an EV charging profile projection that combines travel demand model, EV adoption model, and real-world EV charging data. We find a substantial need for infrastructure upgrades in 50\% of feeders by 2035, and 67\% of feeders by 2045. The distribution system across California must upgrade its capacity by 25 GW by 2045, corresponding to a cost between \$6 and \$20 billion. While the additional infrastructure cost drives the electricity price up, it is offset by the downward pressure from the growth of total electricity consumption and leads to a reduction in electricity rate between \$0.01 and \$0.06/kWh by 2045. We also find that overloading conditions are highly diverse spatially, with feeders in residential areas requiring twice as much upgrade compared to commercial areas. Our study provides a framework for evaluating EVs’ impact on the distribution grid and indicates the potential to reduce infrastructure upgrade costs by shifting home-charging demand. The imminent challenges confronting California serve as a microcosm of the forthcoming obstacles anticipated worldwide due to the prevailing global trend of EV adoption.}

abstract = {As an important supporting facility for electric vehicles, the reasonable planning and layout of charging stations are of great significance to the development of electric vehicles. However, the planning and layout of charging stations is affected by various complex factors such as policy economy, charging demand, user charging comfort, and road traffic conditions. How to weigh various factors to construct a reasonable model of charging station location and capacity has become a major difficulty in the field of electric vehicle charging facility planning. Firstly, this paper constructs the location and capacity optimization model of the charging station with the goal of maximizing the revenue of operators and minimizing the user’s charging additional cost. At the same time, the road time-consuming index is introduced to quantify the impact of road congestion on the user’s charging additional cost, so as to effectively improve the user’s satisfaction during charging. Then, aiming at the charging station planning model, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with an elite strategy (NSGA-II) based on chaos initialization and arithmetic crossover operator is proposed. Finally, taking the Haidian District of Beijing as the simulation object, the results show that compared with the situation of urban traffic networks not considered, the model proposed in this paper significantly reduces the cost of lost time of users by 11.4% and the total additional cost of users’ charging by 7.6%. It not only ensures the economy of the system, but also effectively improves the charging satisfaction of users, which further verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the model, and can provide a reference for the planning and layout of charging stations in the future.}
